## Welcome to 7Ji's profile 

### Skill
Languages I use (only public projects are listed):
 - **C** for system, kernel and other low level stuffs, e.g.
   - [ampart]
   - [eemount]
   - Some work on my multiple kernel forks, e.g.
     - [GCC 12 fixups] for OrangePi5's vendor kernel
     - [attempt to bring OGU support] to existing kernel
   - Some work on [my u-boot fork]
 - **C++** for CLI applications and daemons, e.g.
   - [CargoStranding]
   - [nvr/cpp]
 - **go** for network stuffs, e.g.
   - [mirai-ip-notifier]
   - [router-reporter]
 - **Python** for oneshot scripts and daemons, e.g.
   - [videoArchiver.py]
   - [nvr/python]
 - **Javascript** for web applications, e.g.
   - [ampart-web-reporter] hosted on [my blog site][ampart-web-reporter-page]
   - [CargoStrandingWeb] hosted on [my blog site][CargoStrandingWeb-page]
 - **Kotlin & Java** for Android applications, e.g.
   - [HybridELEC Rebooter] (release only)
 - **Bash** for distros and daemons, e.g.
   - [amlogic-s9xxx-archlinuxarm]
   - [orangepi5-archlinuxarm]
   - [EmuELEC]
   - [HybridELEC]
   - [auto-whu-openwrt]
   - [auto-whu-standard]

I also do reverse-engineering, with some projects sharable including:
  - [ampart] mentioned above, a partition tool that grants you freedom on adjusting Amlogic's proprietary eMMC partition table
  - [HybridELEC] mentioned above, its Android+CE+EE triple bootable image branch (release only) many thought impossible
  - [auto-whu-openwrt] and [auto-whu-standard] mentioned above, open-source alternative to Sangfor's proprietary authentication program
  - [my blog site] has some interesting posts you may want to check up

I also maintain different servers with different distros (ArchLinux, Debian, Ubuntu, etc) with different architecture (x86-64, aarch64, i686, arm, etc) on different providers (AWS, Azure, Bandwagon, self-hosted, etc) around the world, all of them owned by myself.

I also maintain some packages for ArchLinux and ArchLinuxARM, some posted on AUR could be checked [here][AUR]

#### Activity
Outside of writing and maintaining my own projects, I contribute actively to open source projects I'm interested in, most of them are already listed above.

All my Github contributions are part-time activity so please don't spam me with issues or non-issue questions.
